# Jules Agent Manager

A Flutter application to manage and interact with Google's Jules agent. This app allows you to initiate tasks, review plans, and monitor the progress of your AI coding assistant directly from your mobile device.

## Features & Capabilities

The integration with Jules is complete, providing full control over your agent's workflow:

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Secure API Key Management:** Safely store your Jules API key using secure storage on your device.
- **Easy Setup:** Simply enter your API key once to get started.

### 🚀 Session Management
- **Dashboard Overview:** View all your active and past sessions in a clean, organized list.
- **Create New Sessions:** Initiate new coding tasks by selecting a source repository and providing a natural language prompt.
- **Status Monitoring:** Track session status in real-time (Running, Completed, Failed, Waiting for Approval).

### 📝 Plan Review & Execution
- **Detailed Planning:** Review the step-by-step execution plan generated by Jules before any code is written.
- **Approval Workflow:** Configure sessions to require your explicit approval for the generated plan, ensuring you stay in control.
- **One-Tap Approval:** Approve plans directly from the app to authorize code execution.

### 📊 Activity Logging
- **Live Logs:** Monitor the agent's activities as they happen, from planning to execution and results.
- **Transparent Process:** See exactly what the agent is doing at each step of the process.
